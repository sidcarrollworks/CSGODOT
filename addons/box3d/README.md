# Box3D for Godot

A Godot 4.7 GDExtension wrapping [Box3D](https://github.com/erincatto/box3d),
Erin Catto's 3D rigid body physics engine: `Box3DWorld`, `Box3DBody`,
`Box3DCharacterBody`, nine joint types, recording and replay, and the query
and geometry helpers, all as ordinary nodes.

## Install

1. Unzip so that `addons/box3d/` sits next to your `project.godot`.
2. Start (or restart) Godot. Extensions load at startup.
3. Add a node and search for `Box3DWorld`. If it is listed, you are done.

The `bin/` folder holds every platform this release was built for (Windows,
Linux, Android arm64 and x86_64, and threaded web). Godot exports only the
library that matches the target, so the unused ones cost nothing in your game.
macOS is not prebuilt.

The library the editor loads is the `template_debug` one; exported games use
`template_release`. Both are included.
